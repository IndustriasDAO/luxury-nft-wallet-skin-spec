##   Simple Summary

Branded or personalized digital wallet skin, using [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) NFT Protocol.


##  Abstract

We propose a special NFT Metadata Schema that has the style content to load a personalized skin that users can use in their wallet to brand their whole wallet experience.

This proposal also includes brands that can be visually verified, with metadata verification.


##  Motivation

Since Blockchain tech is going mainstream, and the NFT’s exploration of possibilities seems now endless..  Now, we could offer brands and push personalization that will be important as wallets will be part of our day to day activities. 

Also, Innovation on luxury brands will evolve outside their current niche and as Milton Pedraza, from the Luxury Institute, [has pointed out](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/milton-pedraza-1141272_shopping-for-high-end-brands-is-harder-than-activity-6816697734565793792-IGqX/) that “the brightest future of luxury is beyond fashion into a multitude of innovative luxury categories”.


##  Prior Art

Inspired by user-personalized skins on interfaces that have been used to brand and personalize user experiences.

[Winamp Skins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp): Skins are bitmap files which alter the aesthetic design of the Winamp graphical user interface (GUI) and can add functionality with scripting. Winamp published documentation on skin creation in 1998 with the release of Winamp 2 and invited Winamp users to publish skins on Winamp.com.

## Specification


###  Container

The assets will be contained in a zip and it has 4 folders



* /js 
* /css
* /images
* /fonts

The root file is called



* index.json

### Universal Wallet Skin Guidelines


#### 
Three types of wallets that exist:

1. Blockchain Wallets
2. Verified Credential Wallets
3. NFT Wallets

####  Blockchain Wallets


index.json: Which contains the type of wallet that defines the following

use cases:



* Transfer Funds
* Create Wallet
* Import Wallet
* Confirmation Dialog
* Export Wallet
* TransactionLog

####  Verified Credential Wallets

####  NFT Wallets

index.json: Which contains the type of wallet that defines the following

use cases:



* Create Wallet

###  Universal Wallet Skin Implementation


Each wallet maker defines a series of slots, based on the [W3C Web Components Specification Slots Proposal](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Slots-Proposal.md) in this draft; each use case should define the slots where the skinnable content will be blinded.


### Skinable NFT Distribution

The **NFT Metadata URI** is self-describable, it contains the package with the definition of how to render the wallet skin, it also contains the license in JSON format with a digital signature of the owner or designer brand. Thus, not only this token will be signed by the publisher, it also has the certification that can be displayed as an about box (a verification that could be also displayed visually) similar to software licenses.


### Updates

This Specification also allow for skins to be updatable,  that can be done using technologies like IPNS which allows dynamic content ID’s to be updatable, or it can be customized in the smart contract of the NFT.
